16:15:55 : Side: CM. Bjcomings: you are having a laugh
16:16:04 : Side: CM. Bjcomings: let me see how i warn again
16:16:50 : Group: CM. Bjcomings: yo
16:17:00 : Group: CM. Bjcomings: no mic, all good, in heli on our way
16:17:05 : Group: CM. Bjcomings: this pilot
16:17:09 : Group: CM. Bjcomings: aka joker!
16:17:21 : Vehicle: DriftManiac: quick question, has the whole section leaders having to request transport gone?
16:17:29 : Vehicle: CM. Bjcomings: You best have a good reason as to why you troll took off
16:17:52 : Vehicle: DriftManiac: Cause I didnt get a request from a section leader
16:17:58 : Vehicle: CM. Bjcomings: thats not the rules
16:18:06 : Vehicle: Joel: can we please go to
16:18:13 : Vehicle: DriftManiac: well then that shit has changed since I last played
16:18:15 : Group: CM. Bjcomings: nps
16:18:25 : Vehicle: DriftManiac: where to
16:18:33 : Group: CM. Bjcomings: aye, this driftmaniac is going to get it
16:18:43 : Vehicle: Joel: 208188
16:20:16 : Vehicle: Joel: watch out, uav is seeing a lot of AA trucks
16:21:31 : Vehicle: Joel: previous LZ seems hot, try landing at 209191
16:21:31 : Vehicle: DriftManiac: you want me to land in that grid?
16:21:51 : Vehicle: DriftManiac: ok
16:22:06 : Vehicle: CM. Bjcomings: you are too high
16:22:19 : Vehicle: Joel: there is compound there, land north of it pls
16:23:18 : Direct: CM. Bjcomings: enjoy
16:24:16 : Side: CM. Bjcomings: i would help you, but since you fucking trolled me... i don't have time
16:24:49 : Side: DriftManiac: Stop acting like such a dickhead, the rules changed since I last played so get over your little hissy fit
16:26:54 : Side: CM. Bjcomings: the rules have not changed, however, your actions were incorrect. Next time someone borads without permission you as a pilot need to
16:27:09 : Side: CM. Bjcomings: 1. Read the rules, ask the SL to req transport
16:27:20 : Side: CM. Bjcomings: 2. If they don't know, then assist them.
16:27:48 : Side: CM. Bjcomings: Not do what you did and just fly off..... that is not the way we do business
16:28:08 : Side: DriftManiac: Why was I kicked though?
16:28:27 : Side: CM. Bjcomings: Spoke to me like a cunt
16:28:47 : Side: DriftManiac: wow so you can and I cant
16:28:53 : Side: CM. Bjcomings: and i have very low tolorance
16:30:00 : Side: CM. Bjcomings: Your actions caused, in my belief, 2 ppl to disconnect, so yes, I was angry
16:30:05 : Side: DriftManiac: but so if Im getting this right you're allowed to speak to me like a cunt but im not allowed dish it out either?
16:30:49 : Side: CM. Bjcomings: I was never a cunt towards you, remmeber your actions and what caused.
16:31:28 : Side: CM. Bjcomings: when there are 2 or more sections active, then comms is needed to decide who flies where
16:31:50 : Side: CM. Bjcomings: when there is only ONE section.... and 1 pilot stopping them from paradropping.... Your job is to fly them out asap
16:32:02 : Side: CM. Bjcomings: Not troll at base
16:32:18 : Side: CM. Bjcomings: stopping ppl from doing what they were doing before you joined the server.
16:32:39 : Side: CM. Bjcomings: by all means be a pilot - but act according
16:32:53 : Side: CM. Bjcomings: 1 section - no comms req'd - get them out to the action
16:33:13 : Side: CM. Bjcomings: now get my men - ie 1 section
16:33:16 : Side: CM. Bjcomings: to me
16:33:24 : Side: CM. Bjcomings: or disconnect so they can paradrop
16:33:44 : Side: [AB] Manfred Neumann: hupschauber?
16:33:44 : Side: DriftManiac: well they can paradrop

16:46:35 : Group: CM. Bjcomings: Red SMOKE!
16:47:12 : Group: CM. Bjcomings: DriftManiac - no hard feelings buddy, i honesly thought you were trolling
16:48:00 : Group: DriftManiac: nah before back when base was on main airfield the section members had to ask Sec leaders for transport which would then go through HQ/Pilots
16:48:13 : Group: CM. Bjcomings: its still the same
16:48:20 : Group: CM. Bjcomings: but there was 4 of us on the server and you
16:48:45 : Group: DriftManiac: ah k, I guess its a bit more casual when theres less people
16:49:10 : Group: CM. Bjcomings: and by the time we got in your heli, the other 2 disconnected.. leaving just me and Joel...so i was.... well.. nevermind - onwards we go
16:51:31 : Group: CM. Bjcomings: SL - permission to push up
16:51:43 : Group: Joel: yes
16:54:29 : Group: Harvey: all i see from above is a couple guys at the back of the base
16:54:58 : Group: Harvey: they are falling back into the trees
17:02:10 : Group: Joel: how do we defend the base?
17:02:24 : Group: Joel: it looks like everyones dead
