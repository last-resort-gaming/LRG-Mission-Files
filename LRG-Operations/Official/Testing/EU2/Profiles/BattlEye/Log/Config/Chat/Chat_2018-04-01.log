21:18:57 : Side: CM. MartinCo: see if it was localised 
21:18:59 : Side: Pte. Haako: okei
21:19:23 : Side: CM. MartinCo: when a new AO spawns you sxpect a bit of temporary lag as all the objects get added but other than that should be sailing
21:19:55 : Side: CM. MartinCo: I have had it such that arma my side failed miserably, and had to restart arma after it started going on a RAM carnage and stuck at 8fps 
21:20:05 : Side: CM. MartinCo: which is a pretty arma thing
